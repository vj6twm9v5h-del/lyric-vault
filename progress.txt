Iteration 1 - US-001: Project Setup and TypeScript Configuration
- Initialized npm project with npm init -y
- Installed production dependencies: typescript, commander, chalk, better-sqlite3, axios
- Installed dev dependencies: @types/better-sqlite3, @types/node, tsx
- Created tsconfig.json with strict mode, ES2022 target, ESNext modules
- Created src/ directory structure: commands/, db/, ai/, utils/, types/
- Created src/types/index.ts with all TypeScript interfaces:
  - Lyric, LyricAnalysis, LyricSuggestion, SearchQuery, Config
- Created minimal src/index.ts CLI entry point with Commander.js
- Updated package.json with build/dev/start scripts and bin field
- Verified: npm run build succeeds, produces dist/ with no errors
- Verified: npm run dev --help shows CLI help text

Status: 1/20 stories complete
Next: US-002 (Database), US-003 (Config), US-005 (Prompts), US-006 (Formatting), US-007 (Rhyme) - all unblocked

Iteration 2 - US-002: Database Schema and Connection
- Created src/db/schema.sql with lyrics table and idx_created_at index
- Created src/db/database.ts with LyricDatabase class:
  - Constructor creates ~/.lyric-vault directory if needed
  - initialize() creates table and index
  - close() properly closes connection
  - insertLyric() saves lyric with JSON-stringified arrays
  - getLyric(), getRecentLyrics(), getAllLyrics() retrieve lyrics
  - searchLyrics() filters by theme/rhyme/mood using LIKE queries
  - deleteLyric() removes by ID and returns success boolean
  - getStats() returns total count and oldest date
  - rowToLyric() helper parses JSON fields back to arrays
- Verified: npm run build succeeds
- Verified: Database file created at ~/.lyric-vault/lyrics.db
- Verified: Schema has correct table structure and index
- Verified: All CRUD operations work via test script

Status: 2/20 stories complete
Next: US-003 (Config), US-005 (Prompts), US-006 (Formatting), US-007 (Rhyme), US-017 (Database CRUD - already done in US-002)
